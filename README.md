# To-Do List App

The To-Do List App is a React-based application that helps users organize their tasks. Users can add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them. The project demonstrates the use of React concepts such as functional components, hooks, and state management.

----------

## Features

-   **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks by typing in a task description and clicking the "Add" button.
-   **Delete Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the task
-   **Dynamic UI Updates:** The app updates in real-time as tasks are added,   removed.

----------

## Learning Outcomes

While building this app, the following React concepts were explored:

1.  **Functional Components:**
    
    -   Designed the app using functional components for better modularity and reuse.
    -   Components include `App`, `Header`, `Task`, and `TaskInput`.
2.  **React Hooks:**
    
    -   Used the `useState` hook to manage the state of tasks.
    -   Example: Maintaining a list of tasks and their completion status.
3.  **Component State:**
    
    -   Handled dynamic updates for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as complete.
4.  **Props:**
    
    -   Passed data and functions between components for effective communication.

----------

## Technologies Used

-   **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For application logic.
-   **CSS**: For styling the components.
